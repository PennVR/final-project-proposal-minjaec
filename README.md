# HW01: Final Project Proposal

## Proposal 1: A VR experience inspired by [Alz](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634905)
Alz is a flash game inspired by Alzheimer’s Disease. Things appear and disappear, glitch, merge together, and become other objects at random. Trippy experience that will cause some frustration.

## Proposal 2: Visual Drug
Creation of pleasurable and psychedelic visual “filters” for viewing VR experiences and 360 degree photographs.


## Proposal 3: Personal VR Website
This project would serve as a showcase for the existing content on my website and serve as a place to showcase my future VR projects. I want this website to be navigable by *voice* and fully in VR. Can explore interaction with websites in WebVR.
